# Features
A Linked List program with all the Classic Linked Lists Features along with Save and Load feature -

Save function works by serializing Linked List Data into a String, and then storing that String in a file (lltemp). Load function works by extracting String from that file and then converting it back into a Linked List.

# Known Issues
1. Only supports INT datatype
2. Data Structure uses normal INT - there will be bufferoverflow if user tries to input large INTs
